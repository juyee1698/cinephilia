<b><br>- Why do you have multiple pages for the same series?</b>
<p  style="color:#457D63;">For many of the television series covered by Cinephilia, there will be one page, which lists all reviews published at the time the show first aired. (Typically, the critics will base these reviews on the pilot episode only, or perhaps the pilot plus one or two additional episodes, if these were made available to critics in advance.)
<br  style="color:#457D63;">Many acclaimed series (including many of the HBO and Showtime series) will be re-reviewed by critics at the start of each season, with these additional reviews based on all or several episodes from the upcoming season. For such shows, we create a separate page on the site for each subsequent season that gets reviewed.</p>
